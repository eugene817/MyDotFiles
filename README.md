### About me
Currently I'm a student of the second year of NCU (Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun)
I'm trying pretty hard to get the internship/job, because i love programming, especially software engineering
I'm also making music (beatmaking, producing, soundtracks, commertials and many more)

And i tried to switch to linux several times, and i think this is my last try. I really liked *nixos*, and I've tried using 
hyprland (but it didn't work beacuse of nvidia compatibility), so i switched to bspwm with rofi, polybar, sxhkd, picom and feh.
I even wrote a script to easily manage my tasks fot today (that i wrote to my diary) (i know it isn't perfect, but it is working :) )
But I still use dualboot with windows, because working in *ableton live* (IDE for music [DAW]) is completely different on a windows, and i like it.
Ofcourse i tried to use wine with ableton, but for fast worflow is a huge pain, although it works ;)

So there are my .dotfiles
I am still workin on them, to make them better and easier
